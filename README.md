# Genome analysis using an array 

## Description
We will be using a 2D array of queries, attempting to find different N-character sequences in a long genomic sequence.

## Installation & Requirements
1. C++
2. Download genome.fasta
3. Download driver.c

## Usage Examples
You may use this program to find a query within a genomic sequence.

## Project Status
1. Read characters from a file✅
2. Store genomic sequence in a 1D array of characters✅
3. Create and initialize a 2D array of characters✅
4. Sort 2d Alphabetically (TO DO)
5. Find sequences in 2D using binary search (TO DO)
